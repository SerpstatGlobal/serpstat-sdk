![Serpstat](https://images.netpeak.ua/soft/serpstat-logo.png)

**This is the official SDK library for the [Serpstat API v3](https://serpstat.com/api/)**

## Getting Started

### Step 1: Create authentication token

API Serpstat uses the User Token to authenticate requests.
You can create a token on your [profile page](https://serpstat.com/users/profile/).

### Step 2: Install the Package

Open a command console, enter your project directory and execute the following command to download the latest stable version of this bundle:

```console
$ composer require serpstat/sdk
```

This command requires you to have Composer installed globally, as explained in the [installation chapter](https://getcomposer.org/doc/00-intro.md) of the Composer documentation.

### Step 3: Use in application

```php
<?php
require_once __DIR__ . '/../vendor/autoload.php';

// configure your application
$config = [
    'token' => '19666fc1ae1724da1d5ea2f3a99d5f5a',
];

$domain = 'example.com';
$keywords = 'keywords';
$url = 'http://example.com/page1/';

// init client with your serpstat api token
$apiClient = new \Serpstat\Sdk\Core\ApiGuzzleHttpClient($config['token']);

// create instance of any api method class
// e.g. DomainKeywordsMethod
// list of methods classes in folder src\Methods
$apiMethod = new \Serpstat\Sdk\Methods\DomainKeywordsMethod(
    $keywords, 
    \Serpstat\Sdk\Interfaces\IApiClient::SE_GOOGLE_RU
);

try {
    // try call api method
    $response = $apiClient->call($apiMethod);
} catch (\Exception $e) {
    // catch api error 
    $response = $e->getMessage();
}
```
